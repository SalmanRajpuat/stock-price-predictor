3. View technical indicators and market analysis
4. Use "Refresh Data" or "Download New Data" as needed

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from model.stock_model import StockPredictor
from controller.stock_controller import StockController

# Initialize components
controller = StockController()
model = StockPredictor()

# Load and process data
data = controller.load_data('hbl_stock_data.csv')
clean_data = controller.preprocess_data(data)

# Train model and predict
model.train_model(clean_data)
prediction = model.predict_next_day()
print(f"Tomorrow's predicted price: ${prediction:.2f}")
```

## 📈 Results & Analysis

### Key Findings
1. **LSTM Performance**: The model shows strong performance in capturing short-term price movements
2. **Technical Indicators**: Multiple indicators provide robust consensus predictions
